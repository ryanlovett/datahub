Pre-requisites
==============

Smoothly working with the JupyterHubs maintained in this repository has a number
of pre-requisite skills you must possess. The rest of the documentation assumes 
you have at least a basic level of these skills, and know how to get help related
to these technologies when necessary.

Basic
=====

These skills let you interact with the repository in a basic manner. This lets you
do most 'self-service' tasks - such as adding admin users, libraries, making changes
to resource allocation, etc. This doesn't give you any skills to debug things when
they break, however.

#. Basic `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ & `GitHub <https://github.com>`_ skills. 

   The `Git Book <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2>`_ & `GitHub Help <https://help.github.com/>`_
   are good resources for this.

#. Familiarity with `YAML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`_ syntax.

#. Understanding of how packages are installed in the languages we support.

#. Rights to merge changes into this repository on GitHub.

Full
====

In addition to the basic skills, you'll need the following skills to 'fully' work
with this repository. Primarily, you need this to **debug issues when things break** -
since we strive to never have things break in the same way more than twice.

#. Knowledge of our tech stack:

   #. `Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`_
   #. `Google Cloud <https://cloud.google.com>`_
   #. `Helm <https://helm.sh>`_
   #. `Docker <http://docker.com/>`_
   #. `repo2docker <https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io>`_
   #. `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_
   #. Languages we support: `Python <python.org>`_ & `R <https://www.r-project.org/>`_

#. Understanding of our JupyterHub distribution, `Zero to JupyterHub <http://z2jh.jupyter.org>`_.

#. Full access to the various cloud providers we use.
